# Security-Tools
Welcome to my repository of my security tools that are aimed at all security professionals coming back to cyber security and/or beginners starting in cyber security.

This respository will contain all kinds of tools that will be updated every monthly and new tools created every month as well.

## More information

This repository will contain a random ammount of security scripts that may be buggy and/or glitchy. Some are for Capture The Flag and some for penetration testing or known as Ethical Hacking. I am not responsible if you break the law as i am posting these to help people out starting and/or wanting more templates of tools.
